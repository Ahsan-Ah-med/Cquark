# can you write a per loader code 

## Sure, I can provide a sample code for a pre-loader. Here's an example of a basic pre-loader using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

```HTML:
<div id="pre-loader">
  <div class="loader"></div>
</div>```

```CSS:
#pre-loader {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #fff;
  z-index: 9999;
}

.loader {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  border: 16px solid #f3f3f3;
  border-top: 16px solid #3498db;
  border-radius: 50%;
  width: 80px;
  height: 80px;
  animation: spin 2s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes spin {
  0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}```

```JavaScript:
window.addEventListener("load", function() {
  const loader = document.getElementById("pre-loader");
  loader.classList.add("hide");
});```

In this example, we're using a simple circle loader that spins while the page is loading. The pre-loader is shown when the page is first loaded, and then hidden once the 'window.load' event is fired. You can customize the CSS and animation to fit your needs.

Implementing In Shopify Themes

To add a pre-loader to a Shopify theme, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your Shopify theme code editor. Go to "Online Store" in your Shopify admin panel, select your theme, and click "Actions" > "Edit code".

2. Create a new snippet called pre-loader.liquid. You can do this by clicking "Add a new snippet" in the "Snippets" folder and naming it "pre-loader.liquid".

3. Paste the HTML and CSS code for the pre-loader into the pre-loader.liquid snippet.

4. Add the JavaScript code to your theme's main JavaScript file. In the theme code editor, go to "Assets" > "theme.js" or "theme.min.js" and add the code at the bottom of the file. Alternatively, you can create a new JavaScript file called pre-loader.js and add it to the "Assets" folder.

5. Finally, include the pre-loader snippet in your theme's theme.liquid file. You can add the following code to the head section of the file:

{% include 'pre-loader' %}

This will include the pre-loader HTML and CSS code in your theme.

6. Save your changes and test your pre-loader by loading your Shopify store. The pre-loader should appear while the page is loading, and disappear once the page has fully loaded.


Note: Keep in mind that the specific implementation may vary depending on the structure of your Shopify theme. It's always a good idea to create a backup of your theme files before making any changes.
